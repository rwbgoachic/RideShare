# Requirements (Canonical)

**Source of truth:**
- CANONICAL.md
- CANONICAL.json

These are copies of:
- $canonicalBase.md
- $canonicalBase.json

## Rules (mandatory)
- Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) must do **as-is scan first** and mark completion only with evidence.
- Implemented-but-not-documented behavior must be reverse engineered into the canonical document and tracked.

## Folders
- sources/ = raw inputs used to build the canonical requirements
- _archive/<timestamp>/ = older drafts moved out of the way
