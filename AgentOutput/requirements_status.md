## Notes (only items with evidence/gaps/notes)
### BRRS-1.1 — Canonical build rules (strict)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/RideShare/RideShare/Requirements/BlackRavenia_RideShare_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No evidence provided (AS-IS/SNIPPETS) that an agent runs `as_is_scan.md` before changes.
- No evidence provided that `requirements_status.md` is populated with evidence links.
- No evidence provided that `implemented_not_documented.md` is updated as part of the process.
**Notes:**
AS-IS mentions the canonical requirements file exists, but does not include concrete evidence of the required build-rule workflow being executed/enforced.

### BRRS-1.2 — Definition of Done (DoD) (strict by default)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence (routes, db, side effects) showing end-to-end UI→API→DB paths per capability.
- No evidence of automated tests or CI pass criteria tied to DoD levels (Designed/Implemented/Tested/Shippable/Launch-ready).
**Notes:**
AS-IS includes only a small list of UI pages and table names (without columns); no end-to-end flows or tests are evidenced.

### BRRS-1.3 — Required build artifacts (must be produced by agentic AI)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence that `as_is_scan.md` exists (only referenced in BRRS-1.1 text and AS-IS summary).
- No evidence that `requirements_status.md`, `progress_report.md`, or `implemented_not_documented.md` exist in-repo.
- No evidence of required evidence gates (routes/endpoints + DB migrations/queries; tests + CI; staging deploy refs).
**Notes:**
The prompt contains an AS-IS summary, but that is not itself repo evidence of the required generated artifacts.

### BRRS-1.4 — Production readiness gates (GO / NO-GO) (hard gates)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of a deterministic GO/NO-GO gate evaluator script (e.g., `scripts/go-no-go-gates.js`).
- No evidence of `out/k6.json`, `out/chaos.json`, `out/dlq.json` inputs or `out/go-no-go.md` output.
- No CI workflow evidence showing gate execution blocking deployments.
**Notes:**
No CI/workflow or script paths were provided in AS-IS/SNIPPETS.

### BRRS-1.5 — Safe deployment automation (canary + rollback) (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of canary automation (25%→50%→100%).

- No evidence of DLQ analysis tooling and replay estimation.
**Notes:**
AS-IS contains no test/workflow/script evidence for reliability validation.

### BRRS-1.7 — Agentic AI audit outputs (required)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence these audit outputs exist: `AS-IS-REPORT.md`, `COVERAGE-TABLE.md`, `coverage.json`, `GAPS-TODO.md`, `PLAN-TO-100.md`.
- No evidence of refresh-on-demand generation.
**Notes:**
Only the canonical requirements file path is evidenced in AS-IS.

### BRRS-1.8 — Milestones and progress reporting (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of `progress_report.md` updates tied to milestone transitions.
- No evidence of `requirements_status.md` being maintained with evidence links.
- No evidence of milestone completion criteria being evaluated via GO/NO-GO gates.
**Notes:**
Milestone framework is defined in requirements, but AS-IS provides no artifact/workflow evidence.

### BRRS-2.1 — Personas
**Gaps:**
- No explicit in-repo persona documentation evidenced (only requirement text provided).
**Notes:**
Cannot mark implemented; personas are documentation/definition, and no file evidence was provided beyond the canonical requirements.

### BRRS-2.2 — Tenancy and data isolation
**Gaps:**
- No db: evidence that tables include `tenant_id` columns (AS-IS shows tables but columns are unknown).
- No route: evidence showing trip queries are scoped by tenant.
- No test: evidence for the acceptance criterion (Tenant A cannot see Tenant B trips).
**Notes:**
AS-IS DB scan lists tables but with columns=0, so tenancy cannot be evidenced.

**Gaps:**
- No concrete evidence provided (no snippets) showing tenant-aware theming/branding (logo/colors/copy/domains) in rider/driver apps.
- No evidence of tenant-branded payout/reimbursement UX.
- No evidence of ledger vs gateway-name masking (e.g., PaySurity as gateway face) in code, routes, or DB columns.
**Notes:**
AS-IS only lists a few UI page file paths; without code snippets/lines, cannot assert white-label implementation.

### BRRS-2.4 — Role taxonomy (Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)) (authoritative)

UI pages listed do not include any QR/incentives/ledger-specific pages; no route/db/test evidence provided.

### BRRS-9.1 — Tenant dispatcher and operations console
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of a tenant dispatcher/ops console UI (live map, manual assignment, scheduled alerts, disputes/refunds, incident logs).
- No evidence of CRUD drivers/vehicles workflows in a console (beyond existence of driver-app/rider-app pages).
- No evidence of tenant-scoped pricing/policy controls UI or APIs.
**Notes:**
Only driver and rider app page paths are shown; no tenant console implementation evidence.

### BRRS-9.2 — Tenant owner console
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of tenant owner console UI for business settings/branding/policies/staff management.
- No evidence of reports/analytics pages or APIs.
**Notes:**
No console UI paths or routes/tests provided.

### BRRS-9.3 — Platform super-admin console
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of super-admin console UI or APIs for tenant CRUD, feature gates, global policies, kill-switch.
- No evidence of UI/API to trigger and view automated tests.
- No evidence of system health dashboard (metrics/logs/alerts) and RCA surfacing.
**Notes:**
No admin UI or observability dashboard evidence in AS-IS.

### BRRS-11.1 — Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), replay tooling, and failure classification (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of an async job system with DLQ.
- No evidence of failure classification, replay tooling, idempotent replays, or replay audit logs.
**Notes:**
AS-IS contains no routes/files/tests indicating a DLQ subsystem.

### BRRS-11.2 — Chaos testing harness (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of chaos test harness in repository (no test files/ci workflows cited).
- No evidence of GO/NO-GO gates validating recovery.
**Notes:**
No test/ci evidence provided in AS-IS.

### BRRS-11.3 — Load testing harness (k6) (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of k6 scenarios for quote/dispatch/airport queue/messaging.
- No evidence of k6 output export to out/k6.json (or equivalent) or CI gate evaluation.
**Notes:**
No load test files or CI workflow evidence provided in AS-IS.

### BRRS-11.4 — GO / NO-GO integration (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No explicit evidence provided for /health endpoint implementation (no route:... citations).
- No explicit evidence provided for /metrics endpoint implementation (no route:... citations).
- No explicit evidence of SLO collection/evaluation (quote p95 <300ms, match p95 <20s, error rate <0.5%) or a GO/NO-GO evaluator integration (no file:/ci:/route: evidence).
- No explicit evidence of centralized logs with correlation IDs or an audit viewer in a platform console (no file:/ui:/route: evidence).
- No explicit evidence of Google Analytics integration on public site/tenant microsites (no file: evidence).
- Data model requirements (tenants, roles, rider/driver profiles & docs, trips/offers state transitions, policies, messaging, payments ledger/payouts, etc.) cannot be confirmed: DB scan lists tables but columns are unknown, and no db:table.column evidence is available.
- No explicit evidence of state machine implementations (trip/offer/airport queue) or timer registry (timers.json) (no file: evidence).
- No explicit evidence of OpenAPI spec enforcement in CI (no ci:workflow evidence) or admin endpoints for tenant/policy/compliance/effective policy lookup (no route: evidence).
- No explicit evidence of release management requirements (versioned deployments/cache busting/force refresh) or native release pipeline/feature flags (no file:/ci: evidence).
- No explicit evidence of testing strategy implementation for this requirement (no test: evidence).
**Notes:**
AS-IS summary contains UI page paths and a list of DB tables without columns, but provides no concrete, citable route/db/test/ci/file evidence required to mark any portion Implemented/Tested under the strict evidence rules.
